# Writing Sample

The following writing sample is an amended and abbreviated version of my masterâ€™s thesis, Free Reign: The Rhetorical Capture of Pro-Freedom Values by Authoritarian Populists in America. This work was originally submitted on the 29th of July 2022 in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Master of Arts Program in the Social Sciences at the University of Chicago.

Along with a copy of the writing sample itself, this repository contains all relevant replication materials.

Happy replication!

With love and liberty,
